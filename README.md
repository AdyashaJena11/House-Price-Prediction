## ðŸ“– Project Overview
In this project, I built a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict **house prices** using the famous **Boston Housing Dataset**.  
Unlike simple linear regression (Day 1), this model uses **multiple features** such as:
- Average number of rooms
- Crime rate
- Accessibility to highways
- Age of the house
- Tax rate
The target variable is the **house price** (`PRICE`).
## Steps Followed
1. Loaded the **Boston Housing dataset** (from `sklearn.datasets`)  
2. Split data into **train (80%) and test (20%)**  
3. Trained a **Linear Regression model**  
4. Predicted house prices for test data  
5. Evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
6. Visualized **Actual vs Predicted Prices**
